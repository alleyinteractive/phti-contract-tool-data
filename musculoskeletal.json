Next, you will determine the <em>inputs for <strong>outcome measures</strong></em>, which include eligibility criteria, meaningful engagement criteria, and performance metrics. Finally, you will select <strong><em>operational components</em></strong>, which include engagement approach, data sharing commitments, and administrative terms, to include in your contracts.</p><p><strong>A few notes before you continue:</strong></p><ul><li>This toolkit helps you navigate key contracting decisions for performance-based contracts. It does not create a binding legal contract.</li><li>These contracts do not address pricing—a critical lever for driving impact in performance-based contracts. Purchasers and vendors are encouraged to consult <a href='https://phti.org/assessments/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>PHTI’s assessment reports</a> and budget impact models as resources to guide pricing conversations.</li><li>Toolkit responses are anonymous.

Many performance-based contracts today use a clawback model, in which vendors are paid up front, with the understanding that funds will be returned if previously agreed-upon performance guarantees are missed. In practice, though, clawbacks are rarely enforced as written. Purchasers report that this undermines accountability and creates friction with vendors, particularly at the end of a contract.</p><p>A stronger alternative is a two-stream payment model that separates fees for engaged members from performance payments—vendors receive a lower base fee tied to meaningful engagement, with the performance component withheld until outcomes are achieved. This approach maintains some vendor cash flow while withholding part of the fees for demonstrated results.</p><p><strong>PHTI recommends tying a majority of contract value to performance payment.</strong></p>",
