Finally, you will select <strong><em>operational components</em></strong>, which include engagement approach, data sharing commitments, and administrative terms, to include in your contracts.</p><p><strong>A few notes before you continue:</strong></p><ul><li>This toolkit helps you navigate key contracting decisions for performance-based contracts.

          "description": "<p>There are multiple ways to structure your payment. Many performance-based contracts today use a clawback model, in which vendors are paid up front, with the understanding that funds will be returned if previously agreed-upon performance guarantees are missed. In practice, though, clawbacks are rarely enforced as written. Purchasers report that this undermines accountability and creates friction with vendors, particularly at the end of a contract.</p><p>A stronger alternative is a two-stream payment model that separates fees for engaged members from performance payments—vendors receive a lower base fee tied to meaningful engagement, with the performance component withheld until outcomes are achieved. This approach maintains some vendor cash flow while withholding part of the fees for demonstrated results.</p><p><strong>PHTI recommends tying a majority of contract value to performance payment.</strong></p>",
          "note": "PHTI recognizes that performance-based contracts include maintenance or follow-on periods to support sustained clinical outcomes when the evidence base supports it and at an appropriate cost. These periods should be contracted at a lower price point, with performance expectations tailored to member status at the maintenance period baseline. For members that remain above clinical thresholds at the beginning of the maintenance period, performance payment should be tied to improvement and achievement of control. For members already in control, performance payment should be tied to sustaining status and preventing regression.",
