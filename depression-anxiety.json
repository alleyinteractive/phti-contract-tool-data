As a result, many purchasers structure payment models that emphasize engagement-based payments—moving away from flat PMPM arrangements that pay regardless of utilization—while selectively incorporating clinical outcome–based performance payments as programs mature and measurement infrastructure strengthens.</p><p><strong>Review details of each payment model.</strong> PHTI recommends tying a majority of contract value to engagement-based payments to incentivize broad access.</p><p><strong><em>Recommended values are pre-filled.
