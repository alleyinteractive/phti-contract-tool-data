Next, you will determine the <em>inputs for <strong>outcome measures</strong></em>, which include eligibility criteria, meaningful engagement criteria, and performance metrics. Finally, you will select <strong><em>operational components</em></strong>, which include engagement approach, data sharing commitments, and administrative terms, to include in your contracts.</p><p><strong>A few notes before you continue:</strong></p><ul><li>This toolkit helps you navigate key contracting decisions for performance-based contracts. It does not create a binding legal contract.</li><li>These contracts do not address pricing—a critical lever for driving impact in performance-based contracts. Purchasers and vendors are encouraged to consult <a href='https://phti.org/assessments/' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>PHTI’s assessment reports</a> and budget impact models as resources to guide pricing conversations.</li><li>Toolkit responses are anonymous.
