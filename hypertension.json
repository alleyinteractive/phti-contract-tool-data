Many performance-based contracts today use a clawback model, in which vendors are paid up front, with the understanding that funds will be returned if previously agreed-upon performance guarantees are missed. In practice, though, clawbacks are rarely enforced as written. Purchasers report that this undermines accountability and creates friction with vendors, particularly at the end of a contract.</p><p>A stronger alternative is a two-stream payment model that separates fees for engaged members from performance payments—vendors receive a lower base fee tied to meaningful engagement, with the performance component withheld until outcomes are achieved. This approach maintains some vendor cash flow while withholding part of the fees for demonstrated results.</p><p><strong>PHTI recommends tying a majority of contract value to performance payment.</strong></p>",
